# Actions on Google: Dialogflow Docs Samples (Node.js)

This repo contains samples demonstrating the core features of Actions on Google
when building with [Dialogflow](dialogflow.com) and using our [Node.js Client Library](https://github.com/actions-on-google/actions-on-google-nodejs).
Code snippets from these samples are included throughout the Actions on Google
[documentation](https://developers.google.com/assistant).

:warning: These code samples were built using Dialogflow. We now recommend using [Actions Builder or the Actions SDK](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview) to develop, test, and deploy Conversational Actions.

## Setup Instructions
The commands shown below can be used to deploy and run any of the sample
directories.

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and NPM
    + We recommend installing using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
1. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://developers.google.com/assistant/actions/dialogflow/deploy-fulfillment)
    + We recommend using version 6.5.0, `npm install -g firebase-tools@6.5.0`
    + Run `firebase login` with your Google account

### Configuration
#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), New project (this will become your *Project ID*) > **Create project** > under **More options** > **Conversational**.
1. From the top menu under **Develop** > **Actions** (left nav) > **Add your first action** > **BUILD** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. In the Dialogflow console, go to **Settings** ⚙ > **Export and Import** > **Restore from zip**.
1. Follow the directions to restore from the `agent.zip` in this sample's `dialogflow` directory.

#### Firebase Deployment
1. On your local machine, in the `functions` directory, run `npm install`.
1. Run `firebase deploy --project {PROJECT_ID}` to deploy the function
    + To find your **Project ID**: In [Dialogflow console](https://console.dialogflow.com/) under **Settings** ⚙ > **General** tab > **Project ID**.

#### Dialogflow Console
1. Return to the [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com) > select **Fulfillment** > **Enable** Webhook > Set **URL** to the **Function URL** that was returned after the deploy command > **SAVE**.
    ```
    Function URL (dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment): https://${REGION}-${PROJECT_ID}.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment
    ```
1. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes** >  **Test** to open the Actions on Google simulator then say or type `Talk to my test app`.

### Running this Sample
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to my test app”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.

#### [dftest.sh](./dftest.sh)
There is a top-level [test script](./dftest.sh) that runs a smoke test against the Dialogflow agent
stored in each sample directory to ensure intents are configured for happy path flows. The script
checks a given sample's `dialogflow/test/dialog.csv` file to ensure each turn of dialog will trigger
the expected intent.
